    <ul>
        <li><h3>Register</h3>
        <p>If the User decides to select the "Sign Up" option on the "Welcome" page the User has chosen to "Register" a new account with MyVGA. On this page, the User must fill out the three fields introduced to them. The User must choose a "User Name", provide their e-mail address, and create a "Password". Once registered the User will be redirected to the User's Library Page. <strong>PLEASE PRESS F5 TO REFRESH THE PAGE TO GAIN ACCESS TO NAVBAR.</strong><p></li>

    </ul>
<h2>My Games</h2>
    <p>Once the User has logged in/registered, they will be redirected to the "My Games" page. This page is broken down into two seperate sections: "The User's Personal Library" and an "Add Game" section.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><h3>User's Library</h3>
        <p>This section will be the display for the library entries that the User has entered. At the top is a menu consisting of multiple platforms. When the User chooses one of these menu options a list will populate with their games under the given platform. If no games are available under that platform then the MyVGA logo will be displayed. Under each title in the library the User is given two options:Edit or Delete. The Delete button will remove that game from the User's library. The Edit button will produce a prepopulated form ("Title, Genre, Platform") which the User is allowed to alter the entry in case any mistakes were made. Clicking the Submit button will finalize the edit.</p></li>
        <li><h3>Add Game</h3>
        <p>The "Add Game" section consists of a form with three entry fields. The "Title" field where the User may type in the title of the video game, the "Genre" dropdown field where the User may choose from a list of genres to choose from, and the "Platform" dropdown field where the User may choose which platform(i.e. Steam, XBox, Nintendo) they own the current video game on. Once the User is satisfied, they may click on the "Add Game" button to add the video game to their library.</p></li>
        </ul>
<h2>Chat</h2>
    <p>The "Chat" page consists of these three sections: "Chat", "Users", and "User's Library".</p>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Chat</h3>
        <p>The "Chat" section is a public forum in which all users of MyVGA may converse with one another about any topic. The User's name will show up in a gold color, while other users' names show up in red. At the bottom of the "Chat" section is a field for the User to type their message and, once finished, clicking on the "Send" button will submit the message so that other users may read it.</p></li>
        <li><h3>Users</h3>
        <p>The "Users" section is a list of all users of MyVGA. If the User clicks on any other user's name then that other user's game library will populate in the "User's Library" section.</p></li>
        <li><h3>User's Library</h3>
        <p>As stated above, this section populates with the user's library that the User has clicked on. There is no functionality beyond that, yet.</p></li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Logout</h2>
    The "Logout" button on the navigation bar will remove the User's credentials from the storage session and redirect them back to the "Welcome" page.
